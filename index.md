            The baroque period of the arts was the first period in which the historical time created by the nobility and ruling classes was able to express itself as a predominant influence in the discipline of the arts. With the beginning of the Enlightenment, the christian world and its explanation of reality was challenged by science, rationality, lutheranism, and the protestants. The christian world had suddenly lost its unified center, the last remaining vestiges of the mythical society which had emerged from the Roman Empire had finally lost its singular grasp on society, which it had held during the middle ages. This was the collapse of the power of a mythical order founded in Heaven and Earth. The art of the baroque period embodies the change of its times, it captures the ephemeral power and moralities it recognized as they shifted from a mythic modality to a historic modality. As Eugeio D’Ors put it, art during the baroque period chose “life instead of eternity”, which is to say, art started to privilege reality in the here and now, an embrace of the beauty of ephemerality over the promise of an eternal place in Heaven. The outstanding achievements of art during the baroque period were in theater and the festival, as well as the _theatrical festival_, a temporary (and ephemeral) constructed space in which all artistic symbolism and reference were self-contained and self-referential, thus creating a common language accessible to all within this space. The theatrical festival creates a unified space operating as a passage to a cohesive experience away from the disorder occurring in greater society at that time. Thus, during the social upheaval of the baroque period, the theatrical festival became a cohesive refuge during tumultuous times. Contemporary discourse on the topic of aesthetics often places excessive importance on the concept of the baroque, and yet this is a symptom of a growing awareness that a rejuvenation of the classical period of antiquity is impossible in a contemporary social context. Instead, we have tried for the last three centuries brief, artificial, and limited artistic projects imitating the superficial aspects of classicism: worship of virtue, a return to family values, etc. These aspects always promote the authority of the moment, either the nobility, the political class, or even a revolutionary vanguard; but these moments are merely a promotion of the status quo, dressed in Roman togas. Once the baroque moment had run its course, subsequent artistic movements advanced as a procession of ever more individualistic arts of negation, which, from Romanticism to Cubism, each renewing their assault on the previous movements common language and symbols, as well as history itself, until the destruction of a common language of art was completed. This disappearance of an art representing history is indicative of a ruling elite who no longer communicate using history; history had become independent of the ruling class. At the end of the baroque period, the social basis of the elite aristocracy was limited to a playful expenditure of their own wealth; meanwhile, capitalism had appeared to usurp their power, a new power bereft of the hereditary and ideological basis with which the elite aristocracy was laden. This new power whose foundations were the mere running of the economy, ushered in a time with no human elite, but a new elite in the form of capital. The universality of representation across disciplines that so characterized art of the baroque period is perhaps revived by contemporary societies _consumption_ of the totality of the art of all past periods. The _creation_ of artistic works during the baroque period was able to represent the daily life of the ruling class, it has since turned to the consumption of all previous periods in order to create a collage of representations of daily life. As all of the artistic works of the past become accessible for consumption, it is now recontextualized, stripped of the original context in which it was created, reinterpreted for consumption in a contemporary historical context. This transforms the art specific to a time and place with a specific reflection of its own historical reality into a generalized, universalized “world art”: one devoid of any reflection of representation of time, place, or context. This results in a new collage of “world art”; and much like how art in the baroque period reflected elite historical chronology of its period, “world art” becomes an even more abstracted edifice, a new baroque for the contemporary period. Into this edifice all art is melded, both integrating past art and contemporary art forms into a single “world art” in which the art of all ages and societies can be accepted together, signalling the _end of the world of art_. This is now the age of museums, where all art is destined to become relevant _only_ to its continually renewed contemporary context, and its originally intended context, referents, symbolism, and communication will be abolished. Thus the ability of the artist to communicate meaning is lost, both past and present, because the ability to communicate in a common language in general has been lost. When our only ability to communicate is within the time of the contemporary, and the realm of a limited and specific discipline of specialized discourse: we foreclose our ability to communicate in general.
