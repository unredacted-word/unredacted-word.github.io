      A free web edition of our new translation of Debord's <em>The Society of
      the Spectacle</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debord describes and critiques the way we live. The power in these ideas
      lies in their ability to question, identify, and name the common
      assumptions of the present. Developing the concept of The Spectacle, he
      describes the ‚Äúgaze‚Äù of contemporary society. From its publication just
      before, and ultimately influencing the May 1968 revolt in Paris and Occupy
      Wall Street, this book continues to transform a wide range of progressive
      philosophical and political movements, most notably anti-capitalism,
      postmodernism, marxism, and anarchism.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new translation brings a concrete edge to the text, elaborating upon
      the original, and adding annotations. Bringing fifty years of prominent
      radical thinking back to the text, from Baudrillard to Odell to
      Zuboff‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that Debords‚Äô book is more relevant in the era of social
      media, the attention economy, and the emergence of Surveillance Capitalism
      than ever before.
